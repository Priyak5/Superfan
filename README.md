# Superfan

**Superfan** is a social media platform with the vision of providing creators the creative control and financial freedom they deserve. Share decentralized yet private (thanks to Storj) content with your fans.

## Problems with centralized social media?

#### High commission on content

These centralized applications cut deep into creator‚Äôs earnings by charging a fee on every transaction along with a maintenance fee, leading to lesser income for creators.

#### Lack of privacy

Centralized social media platforms often collect and use user data for advertising and other purposes, which can compromise users' privacy. Most of the platforms mandate KYC information to be shared with the platform to monetize their content.

#### Censorship:

Because centralized platforms are controlled by a single entity, they have the power to censor content that they deem inappropriate or offensive. This can lead to the suppression of free expression and the stifling of diverse perspectives.

#### Echo chambers

The algorithms used by centralized social media platforms can often reinforce users' existing beliefs and opinions, leading to the creation of echo chambers where people only hear viewpoints that align with their own. This can limit users' exposure to new ideas and perspectives, and can contribute to the polarization of society.

#### Spread of misinformation:

Centralized social media platforms can be a breeding ground for misinformation, as they often lack strong fact-checking mechanisms and can be easily gamed by those seeking to spread false information. This can have serious consequences, such as undermining public trust in institutions and damaging people's health and well-being.

#### Monopolization:

Because centralized social media platforms are often dominant in their market, they can have a monopoly on the distribution of information and the communication between users. This can give them significant power over users and can lead to abuses of that power, such as the manipulation of user behavior and the suppression of competition.

# Solution - Superfan :rocket:

- **Decentralized** private content platform to empower creators.

- **Censorship-resistant and open to everyone**. This means users cannot be banned, deplatformed, or restricted arbitrarily.

- Eliminates the **‚Äúmiddleman‚Äù** and gives content creators direct ownership and control of their data and content. They can also engage with followers, fans, customers and others directly, with only a smart contract standing between them.

- Built on **Olympus blockchain**, added layer of anonymity and privacy.

- Uses the **Oort DSS** to save and store images on Storj.

- Uploaded images are saved on **Storj**, which is **private, affordable and decentralized**.

- **Zero commision**. Get commission directly from fans without any fee. (Who doesn‚Äôt love no commision :P)

- Creators get commission quickly and directly by their fans in the form of **cryptocurrency**.

- Enables creators to build a **meaningful community**. ü§ù

## How it works?

There are two types of smart contracts. One is the **deployer smart contract** and the other is the **ERC-721 smart contract**. Every user on the platform has their own smart contract deployed on Olympus blockchain. These smart contracts are deployed and tracked by the ‚ÄúDeployer‚Äù smart contract.
